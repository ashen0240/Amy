Lower level

machine code - all 1s and 0s
assembly - basic instructions such as "add x and y" "move x to y"
c - first language with if statements, for loops, super lightning fast
c++, java, python - all programmed in c

Higher level

compilier - takes code and turns it into machine code
programming languages are programmed in other programming languages

Memory:
All memory is 1 and 0, memory is a place to put 1 and 0s - hard drive

Computer science vs software engineering:
Software eng: practice of coding programs
Computer science: is the theory of computing
